Checkout [Heart Disease Prediction Using Bayes Theorem.pptx](https://github.com/Alen-Scaria1516/121CS0237_SEM7_AI_Lab/blob/main/Lab%209/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction%20Using%20Bayes%20Theorem.pptx) to get started.
#### Exercies
1. Load the dataset and use columns cp (chest pain type), trestbps (resting blood pressure), and chol (cholesterol level) as features.
2. Use Bayes' theorem to predict whether a patient has heart disease (target = 1) based on selected features (cp, trestbps, chol).
3. Implement a function that calculates conditional probabilities using Bayes' theorem.
4. Predict whether a patient with a specified set of symptoms has heart disease.
